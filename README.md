# DYNASYS
The software is developed to exemplify dynamical systems like 1. ODEs: Lorenz system, Rossler system; 2. Mackey-Glass System, Equivalent Mackey-Glass System invented by us; 3. Maps: Logistic Map.

This is software to intrgrate ODEs, DDEs and Maps developed by 
Dr. Debabrata Biswas with the kind and useful suggestions of 
Dr. Tanmoy banerjee

to run the software
------------------------------------------------------
extract the "dynasys_0.1.tar.gz" in the home directory
and then
