# DYNASYS (A Dynamical System Solver)
The software is developed to exemplify dynamical systems like 
1. ODEs: Lorenz system, Rossler system, Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey model
2. DDEs: Mackey-Glass System, Equivalent Mackey-Glass System invented by us, Half-wave nonlinear Time-Delay system
3. Maps: Logistic Map.

This is software to intrgrate ODEs, DDEs and Maps developed by 
Dr. Debabrata Biswas (debbisrs@gmail.com) with the kind and useful suggestions of 
Dr. Tanmoy banerjee

To run the software
------------------------------------------------------
extract the "dynasys_0.2.tar.gz" in the home directory
and then

python dynasys.py

System Requirement:
------------------------------------------------------
Python, python-numpy, matplotlib, Tkinter, pydelay
